## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

python 3
numpy, PIL and pyglet libraries

### Installing

1. download the whole repository
2. open it as a project in pycharm or other python IDE
3. set up virtual environment for the project
4. change desired variables in MAP_Elites.py like process count and simulation end
5. run the MAP_Elites.py with the main function
6. wait till the simulation ends
7. data is saved in grid.py and the progress in progress.py

## Running the tests

1. in Testing.py in pick_individuals function, specify where are the grid files
2. change tests in do_tests function if needed
3. run the test from main function
4. use the supplied graphs to highlight the results
